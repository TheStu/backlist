<h1 class="static-h1">About Backpacking Checklist</h1>
<p class="static-text">It sucks to realize, when you're setting up your tent on that first night and getting ready to make a little dinner, that you forgot the matches at home.</p>
<p class="static-text">After enough paranoid nights of packing and repacking before a backpacking adventure, sure that I was forgetting something, I decided to do something about it, and Backpacking Checklist was born.</p>
<p class="static-text">Even with this resource, I cant guarantee that you wont forget something at home. But I can at least guarantee that you wont forget something crucially important, like the matches. And as long as you have the crucial stuff, you can enjoy yourself, which is what backpacking is all about.</p>
<p class="static-text">Sincerely, Backpacking Checklist.</p>
